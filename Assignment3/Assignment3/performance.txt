	I was unable to generate 6 complete runs with the different scenarios so I'll just
look at the ones I was able to achieve which were any with multiple resolver threads.  The
Multiple requestor threads continued to give mutex errors that I am not entirely sure are
because of bad code.  I looked up the error and saw that it generally was generated when
one thread tried to unlock the mutex of another thread, which according to my code is 
impossible.  It is clear to see above with the different number of threads that the increase
in thread number even just for the resolvers greatly impacted the overall run time of the 
program.  I was not sure if I needed to include the runtime of the entire program on here,
but as per the pdf it is generated to stdout at the end of the program execution.  Here,
however I passed in the time that each individual thread ran.  One thread each ran a little 
over 5 seconds, but even increasing the resolvers to 2 threads greatly improved, cutting the 
time for each thread in less than half.  With 5 it improved to just over a second for execution.
