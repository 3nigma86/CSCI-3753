All paging algorithms and code are built exactly as the original pager-basic.c was.  
No modifications were made in the building and running of the programs.

1) Place following files in local directory:
	simulator.c
	simulator.h
	pager-lru.c
	pager-predict.c
	Makefile
	api-test.c

2) Open terminal and access directory containing files and run "make". Then "./test-predict" or 
"./test-lru" depending on which file you wish to operate.
